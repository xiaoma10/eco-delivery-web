# ECO Delivery App

*An app that helps users place, track and manage shipping orders.*

ECO Delivery App is designed for a drone/robot delivery company. The company offers service for small item shipment using drones and robots, which are dispatched from three warehouses sparsely located in San Francisco. 

Users will be directed to enter necessary information to get started with a quote. Our recommendation algorithm will take into consideration distances, agent availabilities and item types to generate the best robot and drone plans. Users can choose between robot and drone, and then complete filling in the rest of order information. Once the order has been submitted, you can view and change your order in the order history menu.
